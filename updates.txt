-----------------

1. Generating the result for different K values for a single month of given year
     - result is being stored based on distance/similarity function
     - month wise and in accordance to the value of K 
2. Completed writing code for FNR calculation
     - Comparing the pseudo labels with actual labels
     - FNR is shown in the bar plot for single month for different similarity metrices 
3. Code is written for generating bar plots for 12 months of given year

4. Added two columns into result CSV file to have the result of Min similarity and Average similarity


Plan for Next:
--------------
1. Working on Active learning part
2. Data selection process based on similarity scores either Min value or Average
3. Selected data points will be sent to further training
