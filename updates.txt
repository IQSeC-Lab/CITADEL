-----------------

1. Generating the result for different K values for a single month of given year
     - result is being stored based on distance/similarity function
     - month wise and in accordance to the value of K 
2. Completed writing code for FNR calculation
     - Comparing the pseudo labels with actual labels
     - FNR is shown in the bar plot for single month for different similarity metrices 
3. Code is written for generating bar plots for 12 months of given year

4. Added two columns into result CSV file to have the result of Min similarity and Average similarity

Observations:
-------------
1. The result shows the concept drift as model is train wity previous year's data, but evaluting with next year data
2. Selecting K as Odd number will be fine to measure majority voting
3. The min value or Average value is closer to 100%, it could be due to distance matrics 

Plan for Next:
--------------
1. Working on Active learning part
2. Data selection process based on similarity scores either Min value or Average
3. Selected data points will be sent to further training
